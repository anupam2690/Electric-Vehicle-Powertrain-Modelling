# Electric Vehicle Powertrain Modelling
Problem Statement: Model Nissan Leaf powertrain in MATLAB Simulink for different drive cycles to plot the Wheel Torque, Wheel Speed, Motor Torque, Motor Speed, Range, SOC, C-rate and Battery Current

Drive Cycles:-
1) Artemis Urban Drive Cycle
2) Artemis Rural Drive Cycle
3) HWFET(Highway) Drive Cycle

--Work Done till now: Powertrain model for Artemis Urban Drive Cycle is modelled.

--Work in Progress: Powertrain model for remaining two drive cycles, Battery and motor cooling models, testing thermal runaway conditions.
